## Overview

This is my solution to the [Interactive comments section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-comments-section-iG1RugEG9). Even though task was for one section, I challenged myself and created almost a full app. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is used to store the data
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) is used for navigating between the different views



### What I learned

I felt that my React Context understanding wasn't clear enough before starting this project, but after finishing it I'm now confident with my Context knowledge. 

### Continued development

I would like to finish loging/signup features. Also would like to learn more about databases and use my own for storing data.
